For the results folder, we designed this folder to only hold those finalized results for publications. Intermediate results such as analysis results should be placed in the Data folder which can auto-sync with server. 

**No files in this folder should exceed 100 MB.**

**Markdown is the suggested format to write documents (instead of Word and Excel files), Markdown can also be used to make slides. Checkout [here](https://gitpitch.com/). However I understand the transition is painful. But you can just spend 5 minutes to learn Markdown which might gain you a job in the future.**

Temporarily, only _markdown_ files (.md, .markdown), at the root directory, would be uploaded to GitHub.

You have the option to sync the reference folder with Nutstore or EndNote. 

If you need any help, or have questions, please post an issue on [here](https://github.com/Wenlab/Template-Project-Repository/issues). I'd like to help you.
