Hi fantastic Trello support staff,

My name is Wenbin Yang, a graduate student at the University of Science and Technology of China.
I was so excited to find such a great project management tool that can integrate so well with my GitHub projects. I'm trying to build up a GitHub-based project management system for my lab. However since GitHub only has web-based mobile interface I have been searching for a good mobile APP to deal with issues on GitHub for a long time until I met Trello.

Trello amazingly fits my dream about my demands on mobile end. However, I noticed that I could only use 1 power-up for my board and limited size (10 MB) for attached files. 

To this end, I would like to request for a discounted business class account.

Best regards,
Wenbin
