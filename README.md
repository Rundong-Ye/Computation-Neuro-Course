# Computational-Neuroscience-Course
This repository serves as an ongoing effort to create a systems and computational neuroscience course for both undergraudate and graduate students. I hope to develop a two-semester course for USTC biophysics students. The first semester will cover some basic materials, and the second semester will introduce more advanced topics for both undergraduate and graduate students.
