I found new idea. Do you agree with me?

# The perfect-lab system

Welcome to the perfect lab system!

# Background
## 为什么明明有更高效的学习/工作方式，人们却不愿意用？
- 不在乎（经济学，息息相关）
- 不相信（别人的方法不适合我）
- 不理解（GTD太复杂了，看不懂）

**_GitHub_ is born to help you.**

It can solve plenty of existing/potential issues for the teamwork, and the personal business, such as:
- 代码，文档的版本控制（e.g., 记录虫子解冻情况的文档）
- 以课题为核心，有组织的归纳整理数据、参考文献、结果
- 以课题为核心，提出、追踪、响应到最后解决相关问题
- 以课题为核心，创建、编辑、整理相关操作与使用说明、注意事项及帮助文档等
- 以课题为核心，进行有效的分工协作
- 追踪整个课题的细节，为写文章提供所需的信息
- 课题结束后完整存档，可以为后续相关课题提供信息，参考

## The GitHub environment and what we should pay attention
![Diagram for GitHub flow](https://github.com/Wenlab/Template-Project-Repository/blob/master/System/Images/diagram-for-GitHub-flow.PNG)
- issues
- wiki
- branch (one branch stands for one issue)
- pull request

[GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

## The usage of GitHub desktop
- pull
- add
- commit
- push

## Nomination Rules
- Chinese can be used everywhere but not names (filenames, foldernames, projectnames, etc.)
- No space in the names, use hyphen "-" instead
- Potential directory issues (please enable custom input/output path in your program.)

# Build up personal website

Personal websites which built with GitHub Pages:
- [RYAN FITZGERALD Software Engineer](https://ryanfitzgerald.github.io/devportfolio/)
- [Academic Template Website](https://academicpages.github.io/)
- [Lantao Yu](http://lantaoyu.com/)
- [A simple demo site](http://hankquinlan.github.io/)

And it is totally free!

Want to build up your website? 
1. Fork a website you like to your repositories.
2. Update the content to your info.
3. Finished.

Tutorial to build up your website: [English](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) [中文](https://www.jianshu.com/p/d344d51bcc4e)

# Markdown is the Official Language
[GitHub flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

> 对于我自己，我承认，我甚至连做加法都不会不犯错。我的记忆力不坏，但也不足以让我成为一个好的象棋选手。为什么令大多数象棋选手感到吃力的数学题，却不会难倒我呢？显然是因为它是由普通的分析步骤构成的。数学证明并不是简单的演绎法的排列，它是由演绎法按特定顺序排列而成，而且排列顺序比元素本身更为重要。如果我对这个顺序产生某种感觉，或称直觉，只需要一眼就能感知到推理的整体，那么我不会担心我忘记其中的一个元素，因为每个元素都是按特定方式放置在这个阵列中的，而不需要我用记忆去牢记。

# GitHub Things to Do (I'll help you build up the system)

### For everyone
- Upload your photo and edit the profile with your name
- try to build up a personal website
- Bonus: [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

### For each team (project)
- Create/Setup a repository imported from the template repository
- Edit the README.md with 1.objectives, 2.methodologies, 3.current results
- Put files to folders and push them to GitHub through GitHub desktop
- Post current issues as issues on GitHub Issues Page
- Create/Copy wiki from the old wiki pages to GitHub wiki in directory style


# Please join us
![You are wanted!](/System/Images/i-want-you.jpg)

where you can 
- learn more secrets about GitHub
- learn much more about how to work/collaborate efficiently
- implement some smart techniques to make a more intelligent life









# If you want to learn more
1. [GitHub Review • Exploring Workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwWZbyjDs9c&t=3056s)
in which it explains the basic idea of git workflow and how to implement it with Github
2. [Webcast • GitHub for Project Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fByt0o4UYs&t=1671s)
in which it explains what the project management is and how to implement it with Github, although it is a little bit outdated.<br>

Any questions, opinions and suggestions are welcome. (please post on them as issues at [here](https://github.com/Wenlab/Template-Project-Repository/issues))

# Mobile solution
I recommend using mobile apps to deal with issues and pull quests in an efficient way. Personally I highly recommend [Trello](https://trello.com) which can seamlessly integrate with GitHub by using [Unito Service](https://unito.io/sync/github/trello/). In this way, members within the same project can know the progress the project and interact in an efficient way.


The No.1 principle of the project repository: 

_**One project, one folder.**_

There are five subfolders: Code, Data, References, Results, Working
## Code Folder
Please put only pure code files in this directory. No test data, no generated files, no compressed files.

## Data Folder
Please put all experiment data and intermediate data in this folder. Do not put anything in its subfolder "links".
You have the option to auto-sync the data with our storage server.

## References Folder
Currently, no files in this folder would be uploaded to GitHub. We suggest you sync files in this folder with Nutstore.

## Results Folder
Currently, no files in this folder would be uploaded to GitHub. We suggest you sync files in this folder with Nutstore.
## Working Folder
Files in this folder would not be uploaded or synced with any other devices/services. This is where you put anything unfinished, such as your programs to generate raw data. Please remember to put finished files into the above folders to keep track of them.
