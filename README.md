# Template-Project-Repository
This repository is a template repository for creating new project repositories.
The No.1 principle of the project repository: One project, one folder.
For the project repository, it has four parts (folders):
1. References
2. Code
3. Data
4. Results

In the Data folder, only link files will be tracked and uploaded to GitHub. Moreover, all data put in the Data folder would be automatically synchronized to the corresponding folder in the server.
