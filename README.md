# Computational-Neuroscience-Course
This repository serves as an ongoing effort to create a systems and computational neuroscience course. I hope to develop a two-semester course for USTC biophysics students. The first semester will cover some basic materials, and the second semester will introduce more advanced topics for undergraduate and graduate students.  

**When**: Wednesday 9:45 am - 11:25 am, Fall 2018

## Summary
To understand how brain functions and how intelligence emerges from the interaction of hundreds of billions of neurons remain one of the biggest mysteries in modern science. Systems and computational neuroscience aims to provide answers to these fundamental questions by bridging insights obtained from different levels of investigations: from behavior, neural circuit, cellular physiology, synapses, down to even molecules. Following rapid progress and development in neurotechnologies and trend in modern brain theory, we will explore the relationship between brain structure, dynamics, and function, introduce experimental tools that allow us to monitor and manipulate nervous system at unprecedented detail, as well as theoretical ideas that identify unifying concepts and candidate principles. We will focus on certain kind of questions that are favored from a physicist standard point of view. Special topics may include efficient representation of information in early sensory system, wiring optimization in neural circuit, dynamics in recurrent neural networks, fine tuning and homeostasis, memory, as well as noise and chaos in neuronal systems.
