# Template-Project-Repository
This repository is designed as a template repository for all non-code/mixed projects. It is a part of the perfect-lab system.
**The perfect lab system [installation](https://github.com/Wenlab/Template-Project-Repository/wiki/Installation)**

For code-only projects, you can create them directly with [create new repository](https://github.com/organizations/Wenlab/repositories/new) with proper README, LICENSE and gitignore files. 

## Why should we use the perfect-lab system
It can solve plenty of existing/potential issues for the teamwork, and the personal business, such as:
- 代码，文档的版本控制（e.g., 记录虫子解冻情况的文档）
- 以课题为核心，有组织的归纳整理数据、参考文献、结果
- 以课题为核心，提出、追踪、响应到最后解决相关问题
- 以课题为核心，创建、编辑、整理相关操作与使用说明、注意事项及帮助文档等
- 以课题为核心，进行有效的分工协作
- 追踪整个课题的细节，为写文章提供所需的信息
- 课题结束后完整存档，可以为后续相关课题提供信息，参考

### Warnings !
1. **请勿添加任何文件/文件夹到根目录 DO NOT ADD ANY FILES/FOLDERS AT THE ROOT OF YOUR SYNC FOLDER**, put the temporary files to the "Working" folder, files to the References folder and the Results folder to auto-sync with Nutstore.
2. **除了the Data, Working folders, 切勿放入大数据(> 100 MB); Except the Data, Working folders, DO NOT PUT ANY LARGE FILES (> 100 MB) IN ANY FOLDER**
3. Please do not edit/rename/move/remove the configuration files again.
4. It seems no Nutstore client for Mac to do the select-sync operation. (Jul. 28, 2018)

### Introduction to the folder structure
The No.1 principle of the project repository: 

_**One project, one folder.**_

There are five subfolders: Code, Data, References, Results, Working
#### Code Folder
Please put only pure code files in this directory. No test data, no generated files, no compressed files.

#### Data Folder
Please put all experiment data and intermediate data in this folder. Do not put anything in its subfolder "links".
You have the option to auto-sync the data with our storage server.

#### References Folder
Currently, no files in this folder would be uploaded to GitHub. We suggest you sync files in this folder with Nutstore.

#### Results Folder
Currently, no files in this folder would be uploaded to GitHub. We suggest you sync files in this folder with Nutstore.
#### Working Folder
Files in this folder would not be uploaded or synced with any other devices/services. This is where you put anything unfinished, such as your programs to generate raw data. Please remember to put finished files into the above folders to keep track of them.

## The transition would be painful
> 对于我自己，我承认，我甚至连做加法都不会不犯错。我的记忆力不坏，但也不足以让我成为一个好的象棋选手。为什么令大多数象棋选手感到吃力的数学题，却不会难倒我呢？显然是因为它是由普通的分析步骤构成的。数学证明并不是简单的演绎法的排列，它是由演绎法按特定顺序排列而成，而且排列顺序比元素本身更为重要。如果我对这个顺序产生某种感觉，或称直觉，只需要一眼就能感知到推理的整体，那么我不会担心我忘记其中的一个元素，因为每个元素都是按特定方式放置在这个阵列中的，而不需要我用记忆去牢记。
