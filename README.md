# Template-Project-Repository
This repository is a template repository for creating new project repositories.

The No.1 principle of the project repository: 

_**One project, one folder.**_

There are five subfolders: Code, Data, References, Results, Working
## Code Folder
Please put only pure code files in this directory. No test data, no generated files, no compressed files.

## Data Folder
Please put all experiment data and intermediate data in this folder. Do not put anything in its subfolder "links".
You have the option to auto-sync the data with our storage server.

## References Folder
Currently, no files in this folder would be uploaded to GitHub. We suggest you sync files in this folder with Nutstore.

## Results Folder
Currently, no files in this folder would be uploaded to GitHub. We suggest you sync files in this folder with Nutstore.
## Working Folder
Files in this folder would not be uploaded or synced with any other devices/services. This is where you put anything unfinished, such as your programs to generate raw data. Please remember to put finished files into the above folders to keep track of them.
