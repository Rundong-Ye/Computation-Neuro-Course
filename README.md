# Template-Project-Repository
This repository is a template repository for creating new project repositories.

The No.1 principle of the project repository: 

_**One project, one folder.**_

There are five subfolders: Code, Data, References, Results, Working
## Code Folder
Please put only pure code files in this directory. No test data, no generated files, no compressed files.

## Data Folder
Please put all experiment data and intermediate data in this folder. Do not put anything in its subfolder "links".
You have the option to auto-sync the data with our storage server.

## References Folder
Currently, no files in this folder would be uploaded to GitHub. We suggest you sync files in this folder with Nutstore.

## Results Folder
Currently, no files in this folder would be uploaded to GitHub. We suggest you sync files in this folder with Nutstore.

## Working Folder
Files in this folder would not be uploaded or synced with any other devices/services. This is where you put anything unfinished, such as your programs to generate raw data. Please remember to put finished files into the above folders to keep track of them.


In addition, people can use this README as a freeGate to explore other components in this GitHub-based project management system.

Currently, we have:
1. [Wenlab Website][1]
2. [Lab Member Project WikiPage][2]
3. [Wenlab GitHub Pages][3]
