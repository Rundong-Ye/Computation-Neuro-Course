Procrastination almost always results from not really having enough clarity about what the outcome is supposed to be or what is supposed to happen next.

### How to stop it (adapted from jamesclear.com)
1. Make the Rewards of Taking Action More Immediate
2. Make the Consequences of Procrastination More Immediate
3. Design Your Future Actions
4. Make the Task More Achievable

**GitHub is the best tool that you can implement those rules.**
