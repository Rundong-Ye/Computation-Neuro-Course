For the References folder, temporarily, only markdown files (.md, .markdown), at the root directory, would be uploaded to GitHub.
You have the option to sync the reference folder with Nutstore or EndNote. 

If you need any help, or have questions, please post an issue on [here](https://github.com/Wenlab/Template-Project-Repository/issues). I'd like to help you.
