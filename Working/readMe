This working folder is a temporary folder which is set for any intermediate working process such as data acquisition and data analysis. Since it is a temporary folder, please move the processed files to correponding folders. (e.g., move acquired raw data, analysis results and other intermediately generated data to the Data folder and move your finialized results for paper to the Results folder)

Warning:

Nothing in this folder will be tracked in both GitHub and server. So the data will not be backed up and your contribution will not be counted if you do not move files to the corresponding folders.

If you have any questions or want to search for support, please post an issue on GitHub and @young24 for help. Thank you.
